Comparing LIME with Intrinsically Interpretable Models

# Research Question:

Do LIME's explanations about black box models align with the interpretability of intrinsically interpretable models like linear regression?

# Key elements to examine: 
1. Do the most important features identified by LIME match those from linear regression?
2. How consistent are LIME's explanations across similar observations?
3. When they disagree, what patterns emerge?

# Results

From the data section, I generated the train and test data, and the two different 
models are based on the data.

I could tell that speaking of the model performance comparison:
Random Forest	 vs. Linear Regression
Mean Squared Residuals for random forest:	11.5135.
Mean Squared Residuals for linear regression: tendency to be higher
% Variance Explained for random forest:	85.9%	
% Variance Explained for linear regression: tendency to be lower
Linearity Assumed for random forest? No
Linearity Assumed for linear regression?	Yes	
Captures Interactions for random forest?	Yes	
Captures Interactions for linear regression? No
Captures Non-linearity for random forest?	Yes	
Captures Non-linearity for linear regression? No

rf_model <- randomForest(X_train, y_train, ntree = 500)
lm_model <- lm(medv ~ ., data = Boston[train_idx, ])
